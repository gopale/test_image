# Mule-3 Object Structure


Mule-3 Object Structure:
![Mule-3 Object](MuleMessage.png?raw=true)

<BR>
Usage: `![Mule-3 Object](MuleMessage.png?raw=true)`
Note: 

- do cannot use "spaces" within file names
- putting quotes around file names also did not work
- don't forget to add `?raw=true` at the end of the file name
